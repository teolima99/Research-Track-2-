# Research Track-2 Assignment

The assignment of research track 2 is divided into three parts:

The first part is to add sphinx documentation to the second assignment of research track 1. 
In the docs folder ther is the documentation, visible at this [link](https://teolima99.github.io/Research-Track-2-/).

For the second part, a User Interface with Jupyter-notebook was created. 

The jupyter-notebook includes the following features:
- Buttons for controlling the robot's motion in the environment
- A plot displaying the robot's position and the positions of the targets in the environment
- A text box showing the distance of the closest obstacle (or a comprehensive plot of the laser scanner)
- A plot representing the number of reached and not-reached targets.

Before running the jupyter notebook, run the simulation at this [link](https://github.com/teolima99/second_assignment_RT1.git).

For the third part, a statistical analysis was conducted on the first assignment of research track 1, comparing two different implementations for handling silver and golden tokens randomly placed in the environment.
To present the findings, I have created a detailed report that includes statistical measurements, graphs, and comparisons. The report provides insights into the performance differences between the two algorithms, helping to identify the more effective solution for handling silver and golden tokens in the environment.
